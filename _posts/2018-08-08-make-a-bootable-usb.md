I know why you are here. Few days ago, I encountered some troubles trying to make a bootable usb drive with Windows 10. So I decided to make this post to let you drink a coffee instead of searching for help.

For me worked very well two apps and I liked them very much, because are intuitive and easy to use. Both of them are compatible with Windows, Linux and MacOS.

## Etcher

I really like this one because the interface it's clean and the design looks more adapted to these days.

## UNetbootin

The graphic interface it's not so clean, but you can make a real deal with this tool.
